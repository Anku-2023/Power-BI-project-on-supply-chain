# Inventory & Supply Chain Management Analysis — Power BI

Interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes inventory, lead time, and stockout risk across SKUs and regions to support data-driven reorder decisions and weekly operations reviews.

---

## Why this project matters
Recruiters and hiring managers can quickly assess supply chain performance and identify operational levers — e.g., which SKUs to reprioritize, which regions face the highest stockout risk, and where transportation cost reductions are possible. The dashboard turns raw order & inventory data into clear KPIs and stakeholder-ready visuals.

## What I built
- An interactive Power BI report (.pbix) with drill-down visuals for SKU, region and supplier analysis.
- Key KPI cards: Warehouse Utilization, Days Sales of Inventory, Inventory Turnover Ratio.
- Visuals include: gauge for utilization, trend of units sold, lead-time donut, backorder status bar chart, and stacked bar inventory by region & category.
- Reproducible artifacts: exported PDF & PowerPoint, plus screenshots for quick review.
